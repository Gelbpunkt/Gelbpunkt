### Who I am

I am a semi-adult coder who's started many years ago with Python, later got into JavaScript, HTML and CSS and eventually learnt Rust, TypeScript and Kotlin. Nowadays I mainly use Rust and Python and do everything from VueJS frontends to parsers and LLVM codegen to scaling Discord bots to a new level or writing Python extensions with [pyo3 and Rust](https://pyo3.rs).

### What I use

Apart from the aforementioned languages, I am a container freak and use [podman](https://github.com/containers/podman) for everything I deploy. I use [Fedora](https://getfedora.org) on daily desktop, Raspberry Pi and servers. I do love [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org) just as much, though.

### What I write

Instead of linking stuff here, just check my repos. Some are more, some less interesting and you might find them useful.

Feel free to mail me if you want to contact me or got questions!
